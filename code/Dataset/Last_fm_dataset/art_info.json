A Perfect Circle has released four studio albums, the first three releasing in the early 2000s: Mer de Noms, their debut album in 2000, and followed up by Thirteenth Step in 2003; then in 2004, Emotive\u2014an album of radically re-worked cover songs titles. Shortly after Emotive's release, the band went on hiatus; Keenan returned to Tool and started up solo work under the band name Puscifer; and Howerdel released a solo album, Keep Telling Myself It's Alright, under the moniker Ashes Divide. Band activity was sporadic in the following years; the band reformed in 2010, and played live shows on and off between 2010 and 2013, but fell into inactivity after the release of their greatest hits album, Three Sixty, and a live album box set, A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo in late 2013. However, the band reformed in 2017 to record a fourth album, Eat the Elephant, which was released on April 20, 2018.Prone to downtime due to Keenan's other musical commitments, the band has featured a variety of musicians in the other roles throughout its alternating periods of activity and inactivity. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Josh Freese on drums; though Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White were also members for a short period in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of A Perfect Circle's songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan writing lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.", "1": "ABBA was a pop music group that formed in Stockholm, Sweden in November 1970. The band consisted of Anni-Frid Lyngstad (Frida), Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog. They topped the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982 with eight studio albums, achieving twenty-six #1 singles and numerous awards. They also won the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with \"Waterloo\".ABBA is an acronym of the first letters of the band members' first names and is sometimes stylized as the registered trademark \u15c5\u15fa\u15f7\u15c5. The band became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1975 to 1982.", "2": "AC/DC is an Australian rock band formed in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in December 1973 by Angus and Malcolm Young. Their albums have sold in colossal numbers; the total is now estimated at well over 200 million copies worldwide, with the 1980 album Back In Black selling over 21 million in the US alone and 40+ million worldwide, making it, according to statistics, one of the best selling albums in the world, outsold only by Michael Jackson's 'Thriller', and tied with Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon'. Their newest album released in 2008 entitled Black Ice is critically acclaimed even ahead of its release. The band has had two distinctive lead singers, and fans tend to divide its history into the \"Bon Scott era (1974-80)\" and the \"Brian Johnson era (1980-present)\".Most fans will agree that lead guitarist Angus Young (Now living In The Netherlands) is the face of AC/DC, appearing on the cover of most albums. His wild stage antics and schoolboy uniform have made him one of the most loved guitar players of all time. He has the unparalleled ability to captivate an audience of over 50,000 people with just the sounds of his guitar and his facial expressions. Most footage of Angus consists of him either doing Chuck Berry's patented Duck Walk across the stage, or of his mop of hair flying around as he rocks through one of his famous solos. Aside from captivating solos, he has also created some of the most well-known riffs together with his brother Malcolm Young.Bon Scott was the second man to front AC/DC back in 1973 (Dave Evans was the first). He would always smile when he was singing and often made a sideways glance towards a camera if it was there with a grin on his face. Also known for wearing a School Girl outfit with pigtails and smoking a cigarette on their first TV performance, with his duties as lead vocalist, Scott also helped to write many of the band's most popular songs. He was lyrically at his best on such songs as \"Let There Be Rock\" and \"Shot Down in Flames\". Sadly, Bon died February 19th 1980 due to alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking in London. It was around this time that AC/DC were starting to get global recognition.", "3": "Adam Green (born May 28, 1981 in Mount Kisco, New York) is an American singer-songwriter.Green attended Emerson College briefly in 1998 before leaving to concentrate on his music, going on to co-found the anti folk group The Moldy Peaches with Kimya Dawson.

Three of its members, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton, first met in Sunapee, New Hampshire in the late 60s, but it wasn't until 1970, in Boston, Massachusetts, that the three decided to form a band together. Later, they met up with Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (rhythm guitar). The band enjoyed major popularity throughout the 70s, making rock anthems such as \"Dream On\" and \"Sweet Emotion\", but they split from 1979-84 due to serious in-group arguments and substance abuse problems that contributed to their decline.Producing a wide variety of tunes influenced both by the 60s hard rock legends as well as the bombastic rhythm and blues artists that the band loved, Joe Perry and Steven Tyler became known as the \"toxic twins\" due to their rambunctious live performances and nasty lifestyles. The Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia reportedly said Aerosmith featured \"the druggiest bunch of guys I've ever seen.\" Classics from their early area with much airplay also include 1974's \"Same Old Song And Dance\" and 1976's \"Back In The Saddle\", with 1973's \"Dream On\" being a concert favorite.Jimmy Crespo replaced Joe Perry for about five years as the band's fortunes failed. However, in 1984, chiefly due to the tireless efforts of Joe Perry's then manager, Tim Collins, to reform the band, Aerosmith was born again. Despite his own client Perry's insistence that it was unthinkable, Collins succeeded in helping the band resolve old differences and ultimately overcome their addictions. By 1989, the band had completely stopped their drug abuse. During this time, they enjoyed a resurgence in popularity that has endured since and has made them one of top-selling and most popular rock bands in the world today. Part of that renewal came in the form of a 1986 collaboration with hip-hop stars Run- D.M.C. on a new rap rock version of Walk This Way. This song served as an early step in bridging the gap between the hip-hop community and mainstream rock and roll fans, and its incredibly popular music video brought both musical groups much acclaim.

The Seven Stars Songfacts reports that Air was commissioned to write a new soundtrack for the premiere of the newly restored Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' silent film, Le Voyage Dans La Lune, at the 2011 Cannes film festival. Although Air's music is often referred to as electronica or trip-hop and is often found in such bins in record stores, their form of electronic music actually owes more to the synthesizer sounds of the 1970s such as Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis.   Another influence is French crooner Serge Gainsbourg. Air's music also has jazz inflections at times, and their ability to improvise is more clearly highlighted in the live arena. Before they founded Air, JB and Nicolas played together in the band Orange, with others such as Alex Gopher, Xavier Jamaux and Etienne de Crecy names which have recently reappeared in connection with Air's remixes. The name stands for \"Amour, Imagination, R\u00eave\", which translates to Love, Imagination, Dream.Air uses many of their studio instruments (like Moog synthesizers, the Korg MS20, Wurlitzer and Vocoder) live on stage. The band performs the well-known tracks from the albums live as extended or altered versions. Air often works together, both in the studio and live on stage, with artists like Beth Hirsch (Moon Safari), Fran\u00e7oise Hardy (\"Jeanne\"), Jean-Jaques Perrey (\"Cosmic Bird\"), Gordon Tracks (\"Playground Love\" and \"Easy Going Woman\"), Beck (10,000Hz Legend) and, on the 2004 tour, with Dave Palmer and drummer Earl Harvin.

The band continued rehearsing and writing stronger material and again entered the studio. The result was the second demo, The Arrival of the Fimbul Winter.

Beck's music is known for its pop-junk culture collage of musical styles, ironic lyrics, samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and heady sound effects.Beck was born in Los Angeles, California, to David Campbell (a musician and son of a Presbyterian minister) and Bibbe Hansen (a former dancer for The Velvet Underground, founding member of the satirical band Black Fag, and visual artist). When his parents separated, Beck stayed with his mother and brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by that city's diverse musical offerings\u2014everything from hip-hop to latin music\u2014and his mother's art scene \u2013 all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work.Although Beck's work defies easy description, his eclecticism and genre experiments have sparked comparisons with Prince, though Beck was undoubtedly a less prolific artist, and drew on an absurdist, free-flowing lyrical style totally original when first exposed to mainstream audiences (indeed, some critics labeled him and his breakthrough single Loser as novelties - see below). Despite this individualism, Beck's music was very much a product of the 90s and the media age in general, with hip hop, indie/underground rock, electronic music and genre-benders like the Beastie Boys as notable touchstones; in addition, some critics could not resist likening his head-spinning lyrical aesthetic to a post-modern Bob Dylan sensibility.", "30": "Beirut is an American indie-rock and world music band which was originally the solo musical project of  Zach Condon (born Zachary Francis Condon in Santa Fe, New Mexico) and later expanded into a band. The band's first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar.Condon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Markovi\u0107 Orkestar and Goran Bregovi\u0107), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. The first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone.

Led by guitarist/vocalist Stuart Murdoch, the seven-piece band has an intimate, majestic sound that is equal parts folk-rock and '60s pop. Murdoch has a gift not only for whimsy and surrealism, but also for odd, unsettling lyrical detail which keeps the songs grounded in a tangible reality. Based in Glasgow, Scotland, Belle and Sebastian released their first two albums in 1996: Tigermilk, recorded over three days, and If You're Feeling Sinister, recorded in a week, at the peak of the chamber pop movement. At first, some critics in Britain's music weeklies tied the band into the subgenre, yet the group was too pretty, too delicate, to bear that label. Through their first two years of public existence, the band shielded their personalities, submitting publicity photos featuring a girl, who was a friend of the band and reluctantly posing for photo shoots. Furthermore, they performed in odd venues, playing not only the standard coffeehouses and cafes, but also homes, church halls, and libraries.Prior to the formation of Belle and Sebastian, Murdoch suffered from a protracted battle with chronic fatigue syndrome, which forced him to drop out of school and spend seven years living in his parents' home crippled by his condition.Whilst in his parents home, Murdoch wrote a short story about a boy named Sebastian and a girl named Isabelle  based on the names from Madame Cecile Aubery's children's book Belle et Sebastian. On New Year's Day 1996, Stuart attended a party at which he met a young singer and cellist named Isobel Campbell. In a letter to his brother Fraser, Murdoch explained how he was making a single for Stow college at the end of February. Murdoch opted to use the name Belle&Sebastian for the project because it was occupying him at the time.  Murdoch took to songwriting as an escapism from the four walls surrounding him in his room and eventually recorded demos with bassist Stuart David whom he met at a government training programme called Beatbox. Murdoch quickly met a series of other musicians through social and musical circles in his hometown Glasgow and they agreed to help with the Stow project. The members he found for this initial lineup were Stevie Jackson (guitar), Mick Cooke (trumpet), Chris Geddes (keyboards), Stuart David (bass), Richard Colburn (drums), and Isobel Campbell (cello). The Stow College record was to be issued by Electric Honey, but it turned into a full album. The course instructor Alan Rankine determined that Murdoch had enough good material to record a full LP and could do so if they could get it all done in three days, studio time allotted for the single. Murdoch and his musicians rose to the challenge and recorded ten tracks putting the songs in order as they would appear on the record and mostly completing them in just a few takes.

Their debut album, 'Grass Roots', was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group's music to be marketable to their audience.

In the early 70s, they were the first to pair heavily distorted, sonically dissonant blues rock at slow speeds with lyrics about drugs, mental pain and abominations of war, thus giving birth to generations of metal bands that followed in their wake. Their name itself taken from a notorious horror film, they are often credited with creating the Heavy Metal genre as well as the doom metal subgenre. Black Sabbath officially disbanded in March 2017.Black Sabbath was formed in Aston, a poor district of Birmingham damaged by bombing during World War II, under the name Polka Tulk Blues Band (soon shortened to \u201cPolka Tulk\u201d), later Earth. Initially a rockin' blues band, Earth moved in a darker direction when the group, especially bassist Geezer Butler, being fans of the black magic novels of Dennis Wheatley, tried to make music to have the same effect as a horror movie or novel. Ozzy Osbourne wrote the lyrics to the second song they wrote together, \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d (the song name was inspired by a 1963 Mario Bava film), and Tony Iommi wrote a riff based on the tritone, sometimes called \u201cDiabolus in Musica\u201d (\u201cthe Devil in Music\u201d).Later in their careers, Geezer Butler would write most of the lyrics to Black Sabbath songs, taking direct inspiration from Ozzy's instrumental ideas. In their Last Supper concert film, the band stated that the song is based on an experience Geezer had one night when he saw a black object at the end of his bed and noticed the next day that an occult book Ozzy had given him was missing.

Founded by Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor.Blink-182 was initially known as Blink until the Irish band of the same name threatened legal action; the band appended \"-182\".

Following a stylistic change in 1992 (influenced by English guitar groups such as The Kinks, The Beatles, The Animals and XTC) Blur released \"Popscene\" as a stand alone single, this was a commercial flop, but was widely considered to be a crucial turning point for the band's style. Following this, Blur released 3 studio albums in a similar style: Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995).

He released his first three albums at the ages of 13, 14, 15, respectively, all under the name \"Conor Oberst\" and released only on cassettes.  He then moved onwards with a band called Commander Venus with whom he released two albums. After the break-up of this band in 1997, Conor's main focus became Bright Eyes, and in 1998 he released the first Bright Eyes album, A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-1997(a collection of 20 stockpiled songs) on the independent label Saddle Creek Records, which he had co-formed earlier  in collaboration with fellow local Omaha musicians.

The interview acknowledges criticisms of his lyrics as overblown and insincere, which had begun to appear as the popularity of the band increased, but responds by stating that the lyrics are meant for personal interpretation. In a 'real' interview with KittyMagik.com, Oberst stated about the mock one: \"It was a way to make fun of ourselves because the record is such a downer.

His first single was released in 1964, but he rose to fame with the 1969 single \"Space Oddity\" and the 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Subsequent albums have explored blue-eyed soul, electronica, and new wave, often pre-dating these genres' popularity or even the point at which they were defined as genres. Bowie was one of the most influential rock musicians from the 1970s to the present. He has sold an estimated 136 million albums in his career and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to his musical career, Bowie has had success as a painter, web-designer, sculptor, Broadway actor starring in The Elephant Man, and film actor starring in many films. Bowie is also credited as being a major inspiration behind the new romantic, futurist movement, and subsequent development of electronic/electronica music.

Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project.

Together with groups such as  Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, they're considered as heavy metal pioneers. Especially influential to later metal bands were Ian Gillan's powerful screams and Ritchie Blackmore's virtuoso solos. Deep Purple were also very influential to progressive music as well, with their style evolving over the years and incorporating a variety of genres from art rock to blues to psychedelia and more.The Early Days:Deep Purple's early output ranged from energetic rock (such as their cover of Joe South's \"Hush\", which became an iconic radio hit that climbed to #4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart) to strongly classically influenced pieces (such as \"April\", a fan-loved gem from their third album). Their first few albums contained very long solos, such as those on the band's covers of \"Hey Joe\" and \"I'm So Glad\". The appeal of the more heavy, arena-friendly tracks from the group brought them considerable success in the U.S., setting them apart from many English contemporaries, particularly in their 1968 debut album 'Shades of Deep Purple'.After their third album, founding member and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore in particular felt the band should move in a harder direction. He additionally felt that then singer Rod Evans and bassist Nicky Simper were incapable of working in that direction. Both were therefore let go, and Blackmore had them replaced with singer Ian Gillan and bassist Roger Glover from pop rock group Episode Six. What is now thought of as the classic Deep Purple line-up came to be when keyboardist Jon Lord and drummer Ian Paice came in, this line-up being often labeled as 'MK II' (in contrast to the previous 'MK I' with Evans and Simper).

Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013 due to cardiac arrest.While they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result they are often coined today as an alternative rock band. Critics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, \"Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement  Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal.\"", "71": "Deichkind is a German band from Hamburg, which was founded in 1999 and originally consisted of MC Malte, Philipp, Buddy and the producer Sebi who died in february 2009.

The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.Dire Straits emerged during the post-punk era of the late '70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to punk. If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of pub rock, but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler, the group built their sound upon the laid-back blues-rock of J.J. Cale, but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of progressive rock. The band's music was offset by Knopfler's lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream-of-conscious narratives of Bob Dylan. As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-'80s helped make Dire Straits' fifth studio album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band - along with Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and Steve Winwood - became one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock & rollers in the late '80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band's international success, they couldn't sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly.Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called \"Brewer's Droop\" at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing \"Sultans of Swing\" on his BBC show Honky Tonkin'. Following a tour opening for Talking Heads, the band began recording their debut for Vertigo Records with producer Muff Winwood in early 1978. By the summer, they had signed with Warner Bros. in the USA, releasing their eponymous debut in the fall. Thanks to the Top Ten hit \"Sultans of Swing\", Dire Straits was a major success in both Britain and America, with the single and album climbing into the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic.", "79": "There are several acts by the name of Disturbed;1) Disturbed is an American metal band from Chicago, Illinois, formed in 1994.

Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his \"whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery\" and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song \"Miss Misery\", included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.", "87": "Eluveitie is a folk metal band from Winterthur, Switzerland.

Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\".Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular\u2014and controversial.In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate, just 42 years of age.", "89": "Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as Eminem (often stylized as EMIN\u018eM), is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, and actor.Eminem is the best-selling artist of the 2000s in the United States.

In 1995 Markus Toivonen played guitar with some friends in a band called \u201dDark Reflections\u201d, which played mainly covers of certain heavy metal bands including Megadeth, Pantera and many others. Later on, Markus felt that the band in which he was playing offered him very little inspiration and wanted to play something different. Markus was hugely inspired by folk music and also found himself fascinated with melodic death metal bands like Amorphis and Dark Tranquillity. Then one day Markus asked the band\u2019s drummer, Kimmo Miettinen, if he wanted to play heroic folk \u2019death\u2019 metal with him. Kimmo agreed. Next Markus and Kimmo asked their friend Sauli Savolainen, if he wanted to come and play the bass. Fortunately, he said yes. Now they had a band. Only trouble was that the band had no name at the time. One day Markus was visiting Sauli at his home, when he found a book; a Latin Dictionary. Markus casually opened the book. And from the first randomly picked page he glanced at a word. Ensiferum. Markus found the word fascinating and the translation \"sword-bearing\" excited him.In year 1996 Ensiferum started its training in January 1996 at the Pasila Youthcenter in Helsinki (the same place their earlier band, Dark Reflections, had their rehearsals). Markus begun writing songs in 1995, which he finished in 1996. The songs were \u201dKnighthood\u201d, \u201dOld Man (V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen)\u201d and \u201dFrost\u201d. Later in the same year, Markus convinced Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 (at the time a member of the band Immemorial, and an experienced solo artist) to join his band as a singer and second guitarist. Jari came aboard with some great skills and excellent musical ideas. Thus the band was no longer a trio, but a quartet. Jari proved to be a skillful lyricist and wrote the lyrics to \u201dOld Man\u201d. The two other songs required no new lyrics, because Markus had done the original lyrics for \u201dKnighthood\u201d and Sauli for \u201dFrost\u201d. So Jari just improved them. Ensiferum had their first concert at Pasila Youthcenter in December 1996.

Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music\".Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and trained as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the Chitlin' Circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by Linda Keith, who in turn interested bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals in becoming his first manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: \"Hey Joe\", \"Purple Haze\", and \"The Wind Cries Mary\". He achieved fame in the U.S. after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, Electric Ladyland, reached number one in the U.S.; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970, before his accidental death from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27.Hendrix was inspired musically by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He helped to popularize the use of a wah-wah pedal in mainstream rock, and was the first artist to use stereophonic phasing effects in music recordings. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: \"Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.\"", "136": "Jimmy Eat World formed in Mesa, Arizona, United States in 1993.

In its early years the band emulated the style of their punk rock influences, and they eventually recorded and released three singles and a full-length, self-titled album on local label Wooden Blue Records.The name Jimmy Eat World did not refer to lead singer Jim Adkins. Tom Linton's younger siblings, Ed and Jimmy, fought constantly when they were younger. Jimmy, who was stronger and heavier, would usually win. On one instance, Ed, as revenge, drew a picture with crayons of Jimmy shoving the entire world into his gaping mouth with the caption, \"Jimmy eat world.\" The picture, and by extension the band name, may have been inspired by an episode of the cartoon show 'Tiny Toon Adventures', where the main characters put on a student film festival. Dizzy Devil's film, \"Dizzy Eat World\", was a 5 second piece drawn crudely in crayon where Dizzy's gaping jaw engulfed the Earth.In 1995 the band signed to Capitol Records.

The band dissolved in May 1980 after the suicide of its lead singer, Ian Curtis.

The daughter of Pentecostal pastors, she was born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson on October 25, 1984 in Santa Barbara, California. Raised by born-again parents, Katy was initially attracted to gospel music, sometimes sneaking pop music in to balance the inspirational tunes, but when she first started singing it was in the church. She picked up the guitar at the age of 13 and soon started writing songs, pursuing a music career in earnest when she was 15. Earning the attention of CCM artists Jennifer Knapp and Steve Thomas, Katy headed out to Nashville in 2001, where she cut demos and eventually secured a contract with Red Hill Records. Red Hill released Katy Hudson, a record targeted at a Christian/inspirational demographic, in February 2001, but the album didn't garner much attention and was ultimately buried once the label was shuttered at the end of the year. In the wake of the album's failure, Perry transitioned toward pop music, relocating to Los Angeles and working with producer Glen Ballard, the chief collaborator of Alanis Morissette, one of Katy's biggest inspirations. As she abandoned Christian music, she also abandoned her surname Hudson, choosing to use her mother's maiden name Perry instead.Ballard signed Perry to his Island/Def Jam-distributed label Java in 2004 but once the producer's imprint severed ties with its parent company, Perry and the album were dropped. Next up, Perry signed to Columbia Records, where she worked on a record for two years, collaborating with the likes of Max Martin, Dr. Luke, the Matrix, Desmond Child, and Butch Walker, but just as the album was reaching the finish line in 2006, she was dropped from Columbia. Perry continued to soldier forth, working as a backup singer for hire (she can be heard on Mick Jagger's \"Old Habits Die Hard\" from the soundtrack to 2004's Alfie), and recording a full album with the production team the Matrix, only to find that album also scrapped.She finally saw a song called \"Simple\" released on the soundtrack to 2005's The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, but her next big break arrived in 2007, when Jason Flom signed her to Capitol.

Her debut, One of the Boys, followed in June of 2008, and it was also a success, supported by the Top Ten hit \"Hot N Cold,\" along with \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas.\" One of the Boys was a big enough hit that the shelved album Perry had recorded with the Matrix back in 2004 saw a release in January 2009, but it didn't do much.", "148": "Keane is an English rock band, first established in Battle, East Sussex, United Kingdom in 1995, taking their current name in 1997.

", "153": "Korpiklaani is a folk metal band from Finland who were formerly known as Shaman. The name Korpiklaani means \"Backwoods Clan\" in the Finnish language. In spoken language \"korpi\" means dark old forest. In biology it refers to boreal forest appearing on moist moraine soils, characterized by dense growth of spruce and a deep layer of moss as undergrowth.While other folk metal bands began with metal before adding folk music, Korpiklaani started with folk music before turning metal. The roots of Korpiklaani can be traced back to a Sami folk music group under the name of 'Shamaani Duo', an \"in-house restaurant band\" created by Jonne J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 in 1993. An album of folk music (Hunka Lunka) was released under this name before J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 relocated and \"Shamaani Duo\" morphed into \"Shaman\".  Shaman was the second incarnation of Korpiklaani, formed in 1996 which is notable for the heavy use of original native S\u00e1mic music elements and lyrics in Northern S\u00e1mi. The band's music was based on the folk music of Shamaani Duo. The most widely used elements are the shamanic drum, yoik and humppa. Besides yoik, the vocals vary from clean to rather aggressive growling.The musical style of Shaman is quite distinctive, especially in the slow songs, due to its entrancing atmosphere created by the monophonic, \"narrow\" synth sound making the deep contrast to the spacious sound of the acoustic guitar, the shamanic drum and yoik singing. The first recording released under the name of Shaman was the demo single O\u0111\u0111a m\u00e1ilbmi (New World in Northern S\u00e1mi). The video clip shot for the song featured a wolf breaking free from its cage and running into the forest. Besides the single CD the song was included on the band's first full-length album Idja (Night in Northern S\u00e1mi, 1999) as well. The band released another album, Sham\u00e1niac, in 2002. The band underwent another evolution in 2003, and \"Shaman\" became \"Korpiklaani\" (with only J\u00e4rvel\u00e4 and drummer Samu Ruotsalainen remaining from the last \"Shaman\" lineup), with the music style to a more conventional folk metal with folk/thrash vocals instead of yoiking. Sham\u00e1niac had already featured a strong resemblance to the future Korpiklaani style. In fact, the song, \"Vuola l\u00e1vlla\", has the same music as the Korpiklaani song, \"Beer Beer\".", "154": "Kreator are a German thrash metal band from Essen, originally started off under as Metal Militia, then as Tyrant and later as Tormentor before permanently deciding for Kreator in 1982. Initially playing a thrash metal with Venom influences, their style of music is similar to that of their compatriots Destruction and Sodom, which are considered the other two big teutonic thrash metal bands from Germany. All three of these bands are often credited with helping create the death metal subgenre.Kreator's work has been consistently in the vein of pure thrash, with the exception of four albums (Renewal, Cause for Conflict, Outcast and Endorama) during the 1990s when they undertook serious experimentation. Incorporating Industrial, Gothic and Avant-Garde elements into their sound, the results were uneven in some fans' and also critics' eyes.Kreator formed as Tyrant in 1982 in Essen, Germany. The original lineup featured vocalist/guitarist Miland \"Mille\" Petrozza, drummer Jurgen 'Ventor' Reil, and bassist Rob Fioretti. They soon changed their name to Tormentor and released two demos. They changed the name of the band again to the final one, Kreator and signed to Noise Records in 1985. The name Kreator is not just a play on the English word \"creator\", it's also a name of a demon in the German mythology. Mille thought it was a cool name so the band settled with this new name instead of \"Tormentor\".", "155": "Lacuna Coil is an Italian metal band from Milan. Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as Sleep of Right and Ethereal. Inspired by the combination of gothic imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs. The band's 2012 release, Dark Adrenaline, peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200. Since inception Lacuna Coil has sold over 2 million records. They have toured internationally and were nominated for a MTV Music Award.Formation and debut EP Vocalist Andrea Ferro and bassist/composer Marco Coti Zelati formed Sleep of Right in Milan, Italy, 1994, and recruited Raffaele Zagaria on guitars, and Michaelangelo Algardi on the drums. After releasing two demos, Bleeding Souls and Noise of Bolgia, Claudio Leo became the band's second guitarist, and Leonardo Forti replaced Michaelangelo on the drums after his departure. The band asked Cristina Scabbia, a friend, to sing background vocals briefly, which led to her officially joining the band. Soon after, the band changed their name to \"Ethereal\", and signed to Century Media at the end of 1997. Finding that the name Ethereal was already taken by a Greek band, they changed their name to Lacuna Coil, meaning \"empty spiral\".Lacuna Coil released a self-titled EP through Century Media in 1998, shortly after Raffael Zagaria, Claudio Leo, and Leonardo Forti departed. As a result, guitarist Cristiano Migliore and drummer Cristiano Mozzati were recruited officially. At this point, the band was touring with Moonspell after the release of the Lacuna Coil EP.", "156": "Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (born March 28, 1986), who performs under the stage name Lady Gaga, is a singer, songwriter, musician and actress from New York City, New York, United States. Perhaps unsurprisingly given her flair for grand gestures, Lady Gaga has deep roots in drama. Gaga played piano as a child and pursued musical theater in high school, regularly auditioning for New York-based television shows, notably landing a background role for a 2001 episode of The Sopranos. At the age of 17 she enrolled at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in their Collaborative Arts Project 21. As she studied, she continued to eke her way into show biz, winding up with an appearance on MTV's short-lived post-Punk'd reality show Boiling Points in 2005. Not long afterward, she left school so she could concentrate on her music, fronting a band called SGBand, which released two EPs prior to splitting. Germanotta then teamed with producer Rob Fusari, a collaboration that produced not only her stage name Lady Gaga, but recordings that led to her signing with Def Jam in the fall of 2006.Her association with Def Jam was short-lived: the label dropped her early in 2007. Gaga rebounded by working with performance artist Lady Starlight, the two developing the Lady Gaga & the Starlight Revue, a tongue-in-cheek neo-burlesque act that gained positive press and proved to be her last stop before signing with Interscope later in 2007. While at Interscope she created a bond with Akon, who convinced Interscope head Jimmy Iovine to have her co-sign with his Kon Live imprint, and Gaga began working with producer/songwriter RedOne, a union that led to the songs that would bring her fame: \"Just Dance,\" \"LoveGame,\" and \"Poker Face.\" These songs formed the foundation of The Fame, the debut album that appeared in August 2008.", "157": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page under the name \"The New Yardbirds\", based on Page's previous band, The Yardbirds. The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock music. However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of \"album-oriented rock\".Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot.Shortly after their first tour, the group's eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as \"Communication Breakdown\" had a unique and distinctively heavy sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on \"Black Mountain Side\" in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\". The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band's career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour.

They compose lengthy, mostly instrumental guitar-based pieces in the style of post-rock, usually focused around the elaboration of a single theme, and are known traditionally for their quiet/loud dynamic, defined bass riffs, and an eminent ambient sound, sometimes dark and sometimes grand. Although frequently referred to as post-rock, the band have revealed in interviews that they despise this categorization, insisting that their sound bears little resemblance to pioneers of the genre, such as Tortoise.

It's a journey which has taken the brothers from their native Kent and Skye from East London to performing for tens of thousands of ecstatic fans in South America and China, along the way releasing seven successful albums of modern music which reflect the most positive aspects of contemporary culture. Paul Godfrey, the band's beatmaster and production wizard, remembers the impact that Big Calm, their second album, had across the world. \"People were almost religious about it\" he marvels. \"I'd get stopped in the street in New York by people who'd been going through a really bad time, and they'd say it was our music that helped get them through this bad period. I still get messages regularly to that effect. It's easy to be cynical but the reality is that's what music did for us too.\"That positive, healing aspect of Morcheeba's music is in full effect on their eighth album Head Up High, reflecting a series of significant changes in the trio's lives.

Lemmy dislikes such labels, preferring to describe the band's music simply as \"rock 'n' roll\" and usually opening live shows with the line \"We are Mot\u00f6rhead. We play rock and roll.\" Usually a power trio, Mot\u00f6rhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart.

Each singer only performed songs they were not previously familiar with, to ensure that each cover would have an individual interpretation.With a name that means \"new wave\" in English and \"nova onda\" in Portuguese (which is the meaning for \"bossa nova\", a new music \"fashion\"), Nouvelle Vague's moniker neatly sums up the group's concept: remaking classic new wave singles with a Brazilian pop twist. Libaux played with various French pop bands during the '90s and began working with Collin in 1998. For Nouvelle Vague, Collin and Libaux recruited half a dozen French and Brazilian vocalists who were unfamiliar with the original versions of songs like Joy Division's \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" and XTC's \"Making Plans for Nigel\" to ensure that their renditions had their own identity. Nouvelle Vague was released in Europe in 2004 and received U.S. distribution in spring 2005, which coincided with tour dates in locales as far-flung as Shanghai, New York, Los Angeles, and Rio de Janeiro. Nouvelle Vague's second album, Bande \u00e0 Part, arrived in summer 2006. The following year, the team returned with Coming Home, a collection of songs from films given the Nouvelle Vague treatment.

Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty.  She began singing at around the age of seven.  Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and parent's rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old.  Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen.  In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant.  She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.At the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates.  In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife.  The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that \"the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist.\"   While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny's Child's cover of \"Emotion\".  Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife.  Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad \"The Last Time,\" a cover of Whitney Houston\u2019s hit \"For the Love of You\" and what would become her first hit, \"Pon de Replay\" to send to various recording companies.  It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna's demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label's then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.", "219": "Rise Against are a punk/melodic hardcore band from Chicago, Illinois.

Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat. After conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical 'British Invasion' into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.  Early on, the band consisted of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best. The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group's 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage. In 1961, Brian Epstein heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous experience in that field. After Decca Records rejected the band with the famous comment \"guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein\", his efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer George Martin, who signed them to EMI's Parlaphone label. Later, due in part to Martin's refusal to use him on recordings, Pete Best was replaced by Ringo Starr, the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Ringo was supposed to play on their first single, \"Love Me Do\", but George Martin had Andy White, a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song). In 1963, The Beatles initiated a craze known as \"Beatlemania\" in the UK with the song \"Please Please Me\". Their first album of the same title was recorded in just one day. This fame spread internationally and, in February of 1964, they arrived in the United States. Their first appearance in the States was on the Ed Sullivan Show, following \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" going #1 in the States. With this success, the Beatles released two feature length films within the space of two years: A Hard Day's Night and Help!. The songs from both films were penned by Lennon and McCartney, and albums followed their release. In Help!, the Beatles were given greater creative freedom, deciding for example to head to the exotic location of the Bahamas simply to shoot one scene.   The Beatles were comprised of four members in the long run: John Lennon (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals), and Ringo Starr (percussion, vocals). Lennon and McCartney were the main songwriters and singers, although songs penned by George started showing up more frequently on later albums. Ringo traditionally sang one song on each record. George Martin produced most of the Beatles' records, and was a highly influential part of the band's sound on most of their records. He also played the renowned solo on \"In My Life\" (Rubber Soul).  For years, The Beatles showed an amazing talent for writing hit after hit. In 1966, they ceased performing in concert (apparently they grew weary of the constant screaming from the fans, which always got so loud they could never hear themselves play; another contributing factor was the extraordinary lengths they had to go to for security reasons before and after each performance) and began exploring new sounds in the studio. This is especially apparent in albums such as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles, sometimes known as \"The White Album\". The White Album  is considered the band's most experimental. The novel sounds featured are due to the growing presence of Yoko Ono (Lennon's wife), as demonstrated by the song \"Revolution 9\", and the band's increasing use of drugs. The song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" (from Sgt. Pepper's) was rumored to be an ode to LSD, although the band vehemently denied any link; they instead insisted that it described a drawing made by John Lennon's son, Julian Lennon. After the death of Brian Epstein, the Beatles began to unravel at the seams. The Beatles officially split at the dawn of 1970; Lennon had unofficially quit the previous year and the band had maintained the front of being together to protect their business interests. McCartney, who was the first to announce that he had officially \"quit\" the band and that they no longer existed, was often blamed for the band's ending although by the end he was the only one willing to carry on and was, by stating the group no longer existed, admitting to the facts.   The Beatles never reunited properly in the 1970s as they never fully recovered from the acrimony associated with their breakup. They did, however, make two new records in 1994, despite Lennon's 1980 death, for the Anthology project. \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\" were based on demo tapes made by Lennon and sent to McCartney by his widow Yoko Ono. They charted in the UK at #2 and #4 respectively. The Beatles also created some of the first music videos, having filmed promotional films in 1965 for broadcasters to show across the US and Europe rather than have to appear live. Their 1967 film promos for \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" have even more similarity to modern music videos, with each one created for just the individual song, and without the appearance of being a recording of a live performance. ", "245": "The Chemical Brothers are a British electronic music duo comprising Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons, who met at the University of Manchester, England, United Kingdom in 1992. Initially they called themselves \"The Dust Brothers.\"  They changed their name in 1995 given the preexisting American production duo \"The Dust Brothers,\" their burgeoning popularity and the threat of legal action from the originals. Thus, their first album as The Chemical Brothers was titled Exit Planet Dust.  Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Underworld, Orbital, Apollo 440 and a few other less-known acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat electronic dance genre to the forefront of pop culture.  They are known for their high-quality DJ sets, an example of which can be found on their album Brothers Gonna Work It Out.Many of their tracks have been in the UK charts as well as those in other countries. Wide belief is that their best album is \"Surrender\" however \"Dig Your Own Hole\" is considered their masterwork by a significant number of Chemical Brother connoisseurs and they are known for producing a style which evolves greatly between albums.  ", "246": "The Clash were a punk rock band from London, England, United Kingdom, active from 1976 to 1985. One of the most successful and iconic bands from the first wave of punk in the 70s, they incorporated rock and roll, reggae, rockabilly, and eventually many other music styles into their repertoire. They were legendary for their uncommonly intense stage performances.From their earliest days as a band, The Clash stood apart from their peers with their musicianship as well as their lyrics, the passionate, left-wing political idealism in the lyrics by frontman Joe Strummer and guitarist Mick Jones contrasting with the lyrical nihilism of the Sex Pistols and the musical minimalism of the Ramones. Their 1979 album 'London Calling' is considered by critics as one of the greatest albums in the history of rock music. Rolling Stone declared it the best album of the 80s, even though it was released near the end of 1979 at first (technically, Jan 1980, in the United States).The Clash's attitude and style, as much as their music, has influenced countless bands, both within and outside the sphere of punk rock. Often lauded as \"the only band that matters,\" The Clash were canonized as rock saints even before they broke up. This was officially confirmed in 2003, when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their five big albums from their heyday ('The Clash', 'Give 'Em Enough Rope', 'London Calling', 'Sandinista!', and 'Combat Rock') continue to earn a great deal of interest from rock fans into the new millennium.", "247": "The Cure are a rock band which formed in 1976 in Crawley, England, United Kingdom. The band originally consisted of Robert Smith (vocals, guitar), Porl Thompson (guitar), Michael Dempsey (bass) and Lol Tolhurst (drums), with the band's lineup overgoing several changes throughout the years and Smith remaining as the only constant member throughout the band's history. The band currently consists of Smith (vocals, guitar), Simon Gallup (bass), Roger O'Donnell (keyboards), Jason Cooper (drums) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar). The Cure has released 13 studio albums and have sold 27 million albums worldwide and are considered a major influence on alternative rock, goth rock and new wave music. The Cure's full lineup history is as follows: Robert Smith (vocals, guitar 1976-present), Lol Tolhurst (drums, keyboards 1976-1989), Michael Dempsey (bass 1976-1979), Porl Thompson (guitar, keyboards 1976-1978, 1983-1992, 2005 -2010), Simon Gallup (bass, keyboards 1979-1982, 1985-present), Matthieu Hartley (keyboards 1979 -1980), Andy Anderson (drums 1983-1984), Phil Thornalley (bass 1983-1984), Boris Williams (drums 1984-1994), Roger O'Donnell (keyboards 1987 -1990, 1995-2005, 2011-present), Perry Bamonte (guitar, keyboards 1990-2005), Jason Cooper drums 1995-present) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar 2012-present)Just as the group's lineup has changed, the band's sound has evolved throughout the years, starting off as a post-punk band similar to Wire and Gang of Four before morphing into a gothic rock band in the early 80's, to a synthpop group in the mid-80's and a power-pop-alternative band in the early 90's. The Cure has always been an alternative and very independent band which was evident from the early days. Shunning the anarchistic tendencies of many punk bands after their formation in 1976 , The Cure's first release was Killing an Arab, based on material from French writer Albert Camus' \"L'Etranger\" (translated into English as The Stranger or The Outsider). This track courted controversy because of its theme (misinterpreted as racist, it was in fact, about the futility of killing any ethnicity), but it started to secure a small following, which grew following the release of debut album Three Imaginary Boys and non-LP single Boys Don't Cry in 1979, the latter of which would become one of The Cure's most famous songs.  At that time, The Cure embarked on tour as the support for Siouxsie & the Banshees' Join Hands Tour. After the sudden departure of guitarist John McKay, Robert was recruited as guitarist for the Banshees as the band 'felt he was the only person capable of taking on the task.' As a result, Robert completed the tour playing two sets a night with The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.", "248": "There are two groups known to have released music under this name. (1). The Decemberists are a folk rock band which formed in 2000 in Portland, Oregon, United States. The band currently consists of Colin Meloy (vocals, guitar), Chris Funk (guitar, mandolin, dulcimer, pedal steel guitar), Jenny Conlee (organ, piano, accordion), Nate Query (electric bass, acoustic bass, cello) and John Moen (drums). Notable former members include Rachel Blumberg (drums, vocals) and Jesse Emerson (bass).Named both in reference to the Russian Decembrist Revolt (they use the national anthem of the Soviet Union as an introduction at many concerts) and to the atmosphere associated with the month of December, the Decemberists write songs that range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads. They often employ instruments like the accordion, Hammond organ, Wurlitzer organ, and upright bass. In their lyrics, they eschew the angst and introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as \"My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist\" from the 5 Songs EP and \"The Mariner's Revenge Song\" on Picaresque. Their songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (\"Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect\") to epic (\"The Tain\") to truly dark (\"Odalisque\"). They often invoke historical events and themes from around the world. Early in their career, The Decemberists' musical and lyrical aesthetics frequently prompted critics to compare them to Neutral Milk Hotel. Since their debut, their sound has undergone a consistent evolution, most notably in the direction of progressive rock with a strong folk influence, though they have also been described as indie rock and, by Stephen Colbert, as \"hyper-literate prog rock.\" For example, one song, \"When the War Came\", uses a little-known story from the Siege of Leningrad to describe the heroism of civilian scientists during warfare. The lyrics state: \"We made our oath to Vavilov / We'd not betray the solanum / The acres of asteraceae / To our own pangs of starvation\". Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov was a Russian botanist whose laboratory, a seedbank containing 200,000 types of plant seeds, many of them edible, was preserved throughout the siege, during which hundreds of thousands of people died.", "249": "The Doors were an American rock band which formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1965.

Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs and, at Manzarek's encouragement, sang \"Moonlight Drive\". Manzarek immediately suggested they form a band.Keyboardist Ray Manzarek was already in the band called Rick And The Ravens with Morrison and his brother Rick Manzarek while Robby Krieger and John Densmore were playing with The Psychedelic Rangers, and knew Manzarek from shared meditation instruction.

Billy Corgan and James Iha met in a record store, and began performing in local nightclubs with their bassist, D'arcy Wretzky, using a drum machine. Playing with a drum machine frustrated both the band and their audience, and so Chicago jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was hired soon afterwards.Less influenced by punk than many of their contemporaries, the Pumpkins had a densely layered, guitar-heavy sound, with powerful loud-to-soft-to-loud transitions, while still picking up grunge, heavy metal, power pop, psychedelic rock, shoegaze-style production.In later recordings, namely Adore, the fourth album, an electronica flair filtered in after Jimmy Chamberlin temporarily left the band for drug rehab. Though  Jimmy Chamberlin returned for their fifth album, Machina/The Machines of God, electronica undertones remained.

Later the pair reunited, and with another friend formed the trio Eskimo Kiss, which signed to Mercury Records but disbanded, in part due to changing personnel at the label. De Martino and White regrouped, working on their own music and others' at Salford's music commune The Islington Mill. Quickly signed to the local indie label Switchflicker Records, the Ting Tings released their debut single, \"That's Not My Name,\" in the spring of 2007.

The sentiment, which, to Bert and his bandmates in The Used, resonated with both extreme simplicity and indescribable complexity, said everything without really having to say anything. Now, the Utah band has titled their fourth full-length album with that very word: Artwork. The group started writing the album after finishing the Taste of Chaos International tour in 2007, slowly collecting and jamming out ideas with no concrete intention beyond making the songs as dirty as possible. The Used, whose last album, 2007\u2019s Lies For the Liars, debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard Top 200, spent the first half of 2008 in LA exploring and refining these ideas, eventually piecing tangential riffs and melodies into a scattering of songs that contained a surprisingly cohesive sensibility.

Tracking for the album began in June of 2008 with producer Matt Squire and eventually concluded in February of 2009, primarily at LA studios The Lair and NRG. Between a few sporadic tours, the band spent about three months total recording with Squire where they allowed their creativity to dictate when they worked on something.
